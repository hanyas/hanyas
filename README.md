## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Hany, a postdoctoral researcher at Simo SÃ¤rkkÃ¤'s group at Aalto University, Finland. I received my Phd from the Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany, under the supervision of Jan Peters. My research is centered at the intersection of decision-making theory and statistical inference.

I am interested in sequential decision-making under uncertainty and tackle those problems within the frameworks of reinforcement learning and information-theoretic stochastic optimization. I focus on developing principled and efficient algorithms for stochastic optimal control, sequential experimental design, and approximate inference in state-space models.
